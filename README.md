# Welcome!

This is Joseph Venturini's GitHub Portfolio. This repository is still a work-in-progress, but for now, here is a table of contents:

### Google Data Analytics Case Study

Inside this folder is an R Markdown document, documenting results on my R analysis for a fictional company called Cyclistic. I don't feel like I've finished this report since I have not done anything in SQL or Tableau for this report, but once I get to it I will update this README file. 

Alongside my R Markdown document, I plan to release another analysis where I use SQL and Tableau to manipulate data instead of using solely R. 

### IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Inside this folder are several Jupyter notebooks that I have used to complete the SpaceX Case Study for tthe IBM Data Science Professional Certificate V2 (See LinkedIn). This Case Study is the culmination of everything I'd learned in the IBM Certificate, such as Python (NumPy, Pandas, SQL, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-Learn, and more) 

### IBM Data Science Certificate Notebooks

Inside this folder are several Jupyter Notebooks where I have made use of:

* Python
  + Basic and Intermediate Python
  + NumPy Arrays
  + Pandas for Data Manipulation and Cleaning
  + Matplotlib for plotting visualizations in Python
  + SQL Magic for using SQL within a Jupyter Notebook combined with Pandas Dataframes [Though outdated]
  + SQL Scripts using IBM DB2
  + Beautiful Soup for Webscraping with Python
  + Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning Theory and Practice

## Future Projects

* The ABA Dataset
  + I plan to go back through all of my previous draft league data and make one huge dataset out of it using Spreadsheets. 

* ABA Web Application
  + I plan to use Python, Django, SQLite, and JavaScript to make a web application to ease teambuilding for players in my freelance project, the ABA Draft League, along with a possible forum, newsletter and other features that allow for displaying of features in The ABA Dataset. 

* Labs from Manhattan College
  + I plan to gether all of the labs I have completed at Manhattan College and put them here as well.
